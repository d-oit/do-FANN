## Command Usage

### Running Commands

1. **In OpenCode TUI**: Type `/` followed by the command name

   ```
   /build-workspace
   /test-all
   /neural-dev
   ```

2. **With Arguments**: Some commands accept arguments

   ```
   /component Button
   /analyze-file src/main.rs
   ```

3. **With File References**: Reference specific files
   ```
   /review-component @src/components/Button.tsx
   ```

### Command Features

- **Shell Integration**: Commands can execute shell commands and include output
- **File References**: Include file contents in prompts using `@filename`
- **Agent Assignment**: Each command uses the most appropriate AI agent
- **Model Selection**: Optimized models for different task types

## Command Structure

Each command is a markdown file with frontmatter:

```markdown
---description: Brief description of the commandagent: build---
Command content with instructions and shell commands.
```

## Customization

### Adding New Commands

1. Create a new `.md` file in `.opencode/command/`
2. Add frontmatter with description, agent, and model
3. Write the command instructions
4. Use shell commands with `!command` syntax
5. Reference files with `@filename` syntax

### Modifying Existing Commands

Edit the corresponding `.md` file in `.opencode/command/` to:

- Change the agent or model
- Modify the command instructions
- Add new shell commands or file references
- Update the command description

## Best Practices

1. **Use Specific Agents**: Each command uses the most appropriate agent for the task
2. **Include Context**: Commands gather relevant information before making changes
3. **Handle Errors**: Commands analyze errors and provide solutions
4. **Optimize Performance**: Commands focus on performance and efficiency
5. **Maintain Documentation**: Commands help maintain up-to-date documentation

## Integration with Development Workflow

These commands integrate seamlessly with:

- **Git workflows**: Pre-commit checks, release automation
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Code review**: Automated code analysis and suggestions
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API and usage documentation

## Troubleshooting

If commands don't work as expected:

1. Check that OpenCode is properly installed
2. Verify the command file syntax and frontmatter
3. Ensure required tools are installed (Rust, Node.js, etc.)
4. Check for any syntax errors in shell commands
5. Review the command output for specific error messages

## Contributing

To contribute new commands:

1. Follow the existing command structure
2. Test the command thoroughly
3. Add appropriate documentation
4. Ensure the command works across all relevant projects
5. Update this README with the new command information
