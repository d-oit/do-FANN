  Issue Tracking Agent - Expert in project management and issue lifecycle management.
  Use this agent for creating structured issues, managing project boards, tracking dependencies,
  and maintaining comprehensive project roadmaps with GitHub integration.
  Ideal for coordinating complex development efforts with proper issue management.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to manage a complex feature development with multiple dependencies.
    user: "Create a structured issue tracking system for a new event-driven feature with proper dependencies."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the issue-tracking agent to set up the project management structure."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires structured issue management with dependencies and project tracking, use the issue-tracking agent.
