description: >-
  Machine learning and neural network specialist. Use this agent for implementing cutting-edge
  algorithms, staying current with latest research, and optimizing neural network performance.
  Ideal for research-oriented tasks and advanced ML implementations.

  <example>
    Context: The user wants to implement a new neural network algorithm based on recent research.
    user: "Implement the latest transformer architecture for time series forecasting."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the ml-researcher agent to implement this advanced algorithm."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires ML research expertise and implementation of cutting-edge algorithms, use the ml-researcher agent.
