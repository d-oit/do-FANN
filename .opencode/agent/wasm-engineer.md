  WebAssembly and CUDA WASM integration specialist. Use this agent for compiling Rust code to WASM,
  optimizing GPU acceleration, creating JavaScript bindings, and ensuring browser compatibility.
  Ideal for performance-critical applications that need to run in web environments.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to compile a neural network to WebAssembly with GPU acceleration.
    user: "Compile the FANN library to WASM with CUDA support for browser-based neural networks."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the wasm-engineer agent to handle this WASM compilation."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires specialized WebAssembly and CUDA integration expertise, use the wasm-engineer agent.
