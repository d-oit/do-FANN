description: >-
  Rust development specialist for the core FANN neural network library with swarm-enhanced development.
  Use this agent for implementing neural network algorithms, optimizing Rust code, and ensuring memory safety.
  Ideal for complex Rust implementations that benefit from parallel development and comprehensive testing.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to implement a new neural network algorithm in Rust with comprehensive testing.
    user: "Implement a new activation function for the FANN library with full test coverage."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the rust-core agent to implement this neural network feature."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires specialized Rust neural network development with testing, use the rust-core agent for implementation.
