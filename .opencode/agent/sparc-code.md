  SPARC Code Implementation Agent - Expert in production-ready code development.
  Use this agent for implementing robust code with comprehensive error handling,
  logging, monitoring, and testing. Includes performance optimization and security best practices.
  Ideal for the C phase of SPARC methodology with focus on production-quality implementation.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to implement an event-driven notification system.
    user: "Implement the event processing pipeline with comprehensive error handling and monitoring."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the sparc-code agent to implement the production-ready code."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires production-quality implementation with error handling and monitoring, use the sparc-code agent.
