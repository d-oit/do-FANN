description: >-
  Computer vision and OpenCV integration specialist. Use this agent for image processing,
  feature extraction, and computer vision tasks. Ideal for applications requiring real-time
  image analysis and OpenCV integration with Rust.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to integrate computer vision capabilities with neural networks.
    user: "Add image preprocessing capabilities to the FANN library using OpenCV."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the cv-engineer agent to implement this computer vision integration."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires computer vision expertise and OpenCV integration, use the cv-engineer agent.
