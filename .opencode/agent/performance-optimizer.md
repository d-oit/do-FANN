  Performance optimization specialist with comprehensive swarm monitoring and benchmarking.
  Use this agent for identifying bottlenecks, optimizing algorithms, and improving resource
  utilization across the entire ruv-fann ecosystem. Ideal for performance-critical applications.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to optimize a slow neural network implementation.
    user: "Optimize the neural network training performance - it's running too slowly."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the performance-optimizer agent to analyze and optimize performance."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires specialized performance optimization expertise and swarm monitoring, use the performance-optimizer agent.
