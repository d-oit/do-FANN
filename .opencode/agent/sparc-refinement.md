  SPARC Refinement Agent - Expert in design optimization and validation.
  Use this agent for reviewing and optimizing designs, validating against requirements,
  refining for performance and maintainability, and preparing implementation strategies.
  Ideal for the R phase of SPARC methodology with focus on design validation and optimization.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to refine an event-driven system design for production readiness.
    user: "Review and optimize the architecture design for a high-throughput event processing system."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the sparc-refinement agent to optimize the design."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires design review and optimization with performance considerations, use the sparc-refinement agent.
