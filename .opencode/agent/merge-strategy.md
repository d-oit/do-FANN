  Merge Strategy Agent - Expert in version control and merge management.
  Use this agent for implementing merge policies, handling conflicts, ensuring testing
  before merges, and coordinating releases with comprehensive validation.
  Ideal for maintaining code stability and managing complex merge scenarios.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to implement a robust merge strategy for a complex project.
    user: "Create a merge strategy that ensures code quality and prevents integration issues."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the merge-strategy agent to implement the merge policies."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires specialized merge strategy with testing and conflict resolution, use the merge-strategy agent.
