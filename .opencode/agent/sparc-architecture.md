  SPARC Architecture Agent - Expert in system design and event-driven architecture planning.
  Use this agent for designing event-driven system architecture, planning component interactions,
  defining message/event schemas, and specifying scaling considerations.
  Ideal for the A phase of SPARC methodology with comprehensive system design focus.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs to design the architecture for a distributed event-driven system.
    user: "Design the architecture for a microservices-based event processing system with high availability."
    assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the sparc-architecture agent to create the system architecture."
    <commentary>
    Since this requires comprehensive system architecture design with event-driven patterns, use the sparc-architecture agent.
